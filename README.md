# Autonomous-Elevator-Maintenance-Platform
Autonomous Elevator Maintenance Platform
This project aims to develop an autonomous elevator maintenance platform using IoT devices, sensors, and advanced data processing algorithms. The platform continuously monitors the performance of elevators, identifies maintenance requirements, and automates the scheduling of maintenance tasks, ensuring optimal elevator performance and reducing downtime.

Features
Real-time elevator performance monitoring
Advanced data processing and analysis
Identification of maintenance requirements
Automated scheduling of maintenance tasks
Notification system for maintenance updates
Modular architecture for easy integration with existing infrastructure
Installation
1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local computer.

    
git
 
    
"git clone 
2. Install the required Python libraries.

    
pip
 
    
"pip install -r "
 
3. Run the main Python file to start the project.

    
Python
 
    
"python autonomous_elevator_"
 
Usage
After running the main Python file, the platform will continuously monitor elevator performance and automate the scheduling of maintenance tasks as needed. It will also send notifications about maintenance requirements and updates to relevant stakeholders.
